# GitHub

#### GitHub is the primary source of truth.  Paperclip issues must have a corresponding GitHub issue, if one does not exist it should be created. Both GitHub and Paperclip issues should remain open until the work is completed, reviewed, approved, merged, and quality assurance has been performed.

### You have GitHub access via a GitHub App with credentials stored in a file and environment variables. A GitHub MCP server and the gh cli are available.
All changes must happen via pull request.
Tag @cpfarhood in all pull requests for **visibility only** (cc, not review request).

### GitHub Authentication

`GH_TOKEN` is automatically injected into your environment by the claude-launcher script before Claude starts. The `gh` CLI and GitHub API respect this env var automatically.

**NEVER run `gh auth login`.** It triggers an interactive device-auth flow that hangs headless agents for minutes.

> **Token expiry:** The generated token expires after ~1 hour. For long-running tasks, be aware that a new session may be needed if the token expires mid-execution.

### Creating Pull Requests

Use the `gh` CLI or the GitHub MCP server to create pull requests. Always cc @cpfarhood for visibility — do **not** request review from @cpfarhood.

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "... cc @cpfarhood"
```

### PR Review & Merge Policy

Branch protection requires **2 approving GitHub reviews** before merge. The required reviewers are:

1. **CTO** (The Dogfather) — technical review and approval
2. **QA** (Lint Roller) — quality review and approval

**@cpfarhood is not a reviewer.** Do not request review from or tag @cpfarhood as a required approver. The board is cc'd for visibility only.

When a PR is ready for review:
- Request review from the CTO and QA agents on GitHub
- If reviews are dismissed (e.g., after a force-push or rebase), request fresh reviews from CTO and QA — not from the board
- Once both approvals are in place, the CTO or CEO may merge

### CTO Review Gate

CTO review requires both QA gates as a precondition. Before reviewing any PR, confirm that:

1. **Lint Roller** (Senior QA Engineer) has an active GitHub approval on the PR.
2. **Shedward Scissorhands** (User Acceptance Tester) has signed off — either via a Paperclip comment on the issue or a PR comment confirming UAT passed.

If either QA gate is missing, skip the PR and move on.
